# humour hoax (Spark AR Filter):
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A filter made under the `School of Innovation India from facebook` AR101 Final Project,  Used the patch editor to create an interactive clown mask effect that is affected by the user's mouth interactions.

Rubric:

- Used the Face Target to place a red ball on top of your nose
- Used any Face Interaction or Face Landmark patch on the patch editor to detect a change in the user's mouth.
- This interaction animates the scale of the red ball to grow bigger by using patches.
- When the user brings their face back to normal, the red ball returns to normal size.
- Used an interaction patch to detect a tap on the screen and on doing so the ball disappears.
- Made the ball reappear on tapping the screen again.
- Added in own textures to the face mesh to create a unique clown mask which is creative.
- Tested and Published the effect out on the Spark AR Player app.
